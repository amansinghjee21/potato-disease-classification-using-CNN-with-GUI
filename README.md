# Potato Disease Classification Using CNN with GUI

This project showcases a machine learning solution for classifying potato leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The primary goal is to accurately identify common diseases in potato plants from leaf images, providing an essential tool for farmers and agricultural professionals.

### Project Overview

In this project, I developed a CNN model to classify potato diseases from images. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of potato leaves affected by different diseases, as well as healthy leaves. The deep learning model processes these images, extracting features and learning patterns to differentiate between the diseases effectively.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

To make the model user-friendly, I created a GUI using the `Tkinter` library in Python. This interface allows users to upload an image of a potato leaf, which is then processed by the trained CNN model to predict the presence of any disease. The GUI provides an easy-to-use platform for users with minimal technical knowledge to diagnose potato plant diseases quickly.

### Features

- **CNN Model**: A robust Convolutional Neural Network for image classification.
- **Tkinter GUI**: A simple and intuitive graphical interface for image upload and disease prediction.
- **Accuracy**: The model is trained to achieve high accuracy, making it a reliable tool for disease classification.
